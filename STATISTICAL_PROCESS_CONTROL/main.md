> The Need for Predictable Quality
- Two Categories which cases the variability
  - **Common** Causes which causes the natural variability
  - **Special** Causes which are responsible for extraordinary variability
- Two different controls: **under control** and **out of control**
## How to Distinguish between Common Causes and Special Causes for Variation
> The simplest rule to tell you whether or not a special cause is present is whether there is a value outside the control limits or not
### UCL and LCL
```
Upper control limit: UCL = AVE + 3σ
Lower control limit: LCL = AVE - 3σ

Upper specification limit: USL
Lower specification limit: LSL
```
## Control Limits and Specification Limits: Is the Process Capable?
### Capability index
- Process Cp
```
Cp = (USL – LSL) / 6σ
```
- Process Cpk
> Cpk is always smaller than Cp
```
Cpk = min[(USL- AVE),(AVE – LSL) / 3σ
```
