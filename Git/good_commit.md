# Rules
## Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: "If applied, this commit will **your subject line here**"
For example:
- (O) If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
- (X) If applied, this commit will ~~fixed bug with Y~~
