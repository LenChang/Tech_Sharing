# Question: Empty vs. Never vs. Of
- [Article Link](https://upmostly.com/angular/empty-vs-never-vs-of-in-rxjs-angular)
## EMPTY
> It’s important here to note that while the observer is completed, it emits nothing on it’s way to doing so
```
EMPTY.subscribe(x => {
  console.log('Empty Emit'); //This never fires. 
}, 
null, 
() => {
  console.log('Empty Complete'); //This does. 
});
```
## Of
> I have used of({}), if you instead use Of() with no value, then you will instead complete the observable but not emit a value (Similar to EMPTY).
```
of({}).subscribe(x => {
  console.log('Of Emit'); //This fires. 
}, 
null, 
() => {
  console.log('Of Complete'); //This fires. 
});
```
# delete operator in Rxjs pipe flow
- [Article Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete)
> something which is similar to tap() of txjs to cover tag() ? 
```
      map((x) =>
        Object.values(x as unknown as { [modelId: string]: IModel }).map((model) => {
          const labels = model.labelsAndPhotos.reduce((pre, curr) => ({/*--something--*/}), {});
          delete model.labelsAndPhotos;
          return { /*--something--*/ };
        })
      ),
```
